# Docker introduction
This repository is created as an introduction to docker, the repository will have a few branches each with different progress of the introduction.

## Part One
Creating a simple node application.
- To initialize your local directory with a package json, run
```js
npm init
```
You can also manually create your own `package.json`.

- Installing the required dependencies for our mini node application.
For this application we will be using [express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
```js
npm install express
```

## Part Two
Dockerize our node application.
- Here we will go through the main topic of the day where we will introduce docker into our project.
create a `Dockerfile` in our current directory.
