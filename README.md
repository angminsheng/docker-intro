# Docker introduction
This repository is created as an introduction to docker, the repository will have a few branches each with different progress of the introduction.

### Part One
Creating a simple node application.
- To initialize your local directory with a package json, run
```js
npm init
```
You can also manually create your own `package.json`.

For this application we will be using [express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
